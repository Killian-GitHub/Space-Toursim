## Space Tourism

Hi there üëãüèª

This project is a realization of the frontend mentor challenge (which you will find here: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3). It is a multi-page site made with Next.JS and Sass which includes a responsive design for each type of screen.

## Embark on the journey

To consult the site two options are available to you:

# See website

You can consult the site posted on Vercel at this address: https://space-toursim-q3n1qc7ow-killian.vercel.app/

# Download and launch the project

If you want to launch the project from your machine, you just have to download the source code and install the dependencies necessary for operation from your terminal using the "yarn install" or "npm install" command, then launch your server in order to consult the site in your browser.
